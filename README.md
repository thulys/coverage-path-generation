# coverage-path-generation
designed for Catabot  
existing problems:  
paths travel between cells may exceed the bundary of the area.  
only apply to cases that have 2 depth levels  
future work:   
automatically decide if it's necessary to split the polygon when the path passes through a visited cell.  
reduce runtime
